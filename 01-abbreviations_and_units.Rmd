# Abbreviations and Units

## Abbreviations and Units
The following table \@ref(tab:abbreviations) shows the abbreviations used in echocardiography along with the units of measurement that are most typically used in the Turku area, based on my experience. At the end of the list, there are also some echocardiographic findings that may be described in reports using abbreviations.

Below the table, there is a broader [discussion on the topic](#abbreviations_additional_info).

**The purpose is not to memorize anything from this table; you learn the abbreviations when learning each structure in the later chapters of this guide. However, the table can serve as an aid when preparing your first reports.**

## Abbreviations: Additional Information {#abbreviations_additional_info}

Echocardiographic reports are full of letter abbreviations that are derived directly from the names of the structures being described. These abbreviations must be known in order to be able to dictate the echocardiographic studies you perform and interpret reports prepared by others. Additionally, projections have their own corresponding logical letter abbreviations that are worth learning. There are about twenty abbreviations in total, and they are all logical and easy.

Those practicing echocardiography also often ask what unit of measurement to use in each measurement. My experience is that the use of units is not entirely consistent - for example, certain velocities are described in m/s units and others in cm/s units.

Certain findings may also be described using abbreviations. This may not be the best solution for readability, but echocardiographic reports are probably generally difficult to read if you don't perform echocardiography yourself. I wouldn't rule out using the abbreviations for findings presented in table \@ref(tab:abbreviations) if there's a small summary at the end of the report in human-readable language - I strongly recommend such a summary in general.
