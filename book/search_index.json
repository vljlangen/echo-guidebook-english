This English version has been ported from the Finnish original. Some images currently contain Finnish text but are still usable for learning purposes. These will be translated in future updates. This guide introduces the basics of echocardiography, such as how to obtain different projections (imaging views) of the heart and how to perform various measurements with an ultrasound device. The guide is primarily aimed at beginners - for example, physicians who are interested in learning to perform echocardiography themselves or interpreting echocardiographic measurements. The measurement functions are presented in this guide using the buttons and menus of the Philips CX50 device. However, the principles are the same in all echocardiography devices, so the measurements presented are largely universal. When you learn to use one echocardiography device, you know the basic functions in all different devices, regardless of the device manufacturer. There are two major manufacturers: Philips and GE. Often, all echocardiography devices in a hospital or at least in a result area are manufactured by one of these companies. Both companies’ devices have their own strengths and their own advocates. There are regional differences in performing echocardiography even within Finland, which I have tried to pay some attention to in this guide. Even the abbreviation “UKG”, which is used to refer concisely to cardiac echocardiography in the Turku area, is not used in all parts of Finland. (When going further north, cardiology colleagues reportedly use the term “ekko”.) The content of this guide is based on the undersigned’s experiences from ward and outpatient clinic work. I offer in this guide my own views on how the different areas of echocardiography are easiest to understand and learn. There are separate source references to scientific publications in some sections. The guide does not need to be read chronologically - read what you need and ignore the rest. Please note that this guide is not a treatment recommendation, and the reader uses the guide to support their learning entirely at their own responsibility. There is plenty of additional content for learning echocardiography on the internet.

At the end of the list, there are also some echocardiographic findings that may be described in reports using abbreviations. Below the table, there is a broader discussion on the topic. The purpose is not to memorize anything from this table; you learn the abbreviations when learning each structure in the later chapters of this guide. However, the table can serve as an aid when preparing your first reports. Table 2.1: Most common abbreviations appearing in echocardiographic reports.

These abbreviations must be known in order to be able to dictate the echocardiographic studies you perform and interpret reports prepared by others. Additionally, projections have their own corresponding logical letter abbreviations that are worth learning. There are about twenty abbreviations in total, and they are all logical and easy. Those practicing echocardiography also often ask what unit of measurement to use in each measurement. My experience is that the use of units is not entirely consistent - for example, certain velocities are described in m/s units and others in cm/s units. Certain findings may also be described using abbreviations. This may not be the best solution for readability, but echocardiographic reports are probably generally difficult to read if you don’t perform echocardiography yourself. I wouldn’t rule out using the abbreviations for findings presented in table 2.1 if there’s a small summary at the end of the report in human-readable language - I strongly recommend such a summary in general.

Note! You don’t need to memorize the buttons at this point - they will be covered later in connection with each function presented in this guide. Figure 3.1: Philips CX50 echocardiography device buttons. The most important buttons of the Philips CX50 device (marked with white numbers): Power button: you can get very far just by pressing this 2D button: if the echocardiography device goes into some function from which you want to exit, pressing this button usually returns the device to its “initial state” Trackball: this can be used to move the cursor and zoom window, among other things Freeze: this stops the moving image into a still image Caliper: this allows you to quickly make almost any “quick and dirty” measurements without needing to go into the device’s internal, structural measurement parameters (the latter are accessed with the Calc button) Trackball left button: necessary for various types of measurements Color Doppler: practically mandatory for diagnosing valve regurgitation and stenosis CW (continuous wave Doppler): button needed for measuring high-velocity blood flows PW (pulsed wave Doppler): button needed for measuring slower blood flows from a specific, cursor-indicated point M-mode: M-mode produces a one-dimensional representation of a specific cardiac cross-section as a function of time, which is very useful for measuring left ventricular cross-sectional dimensions and simultaneously the ejection fraction Calc: with this button you can name structurally measured dimensions from the heart, whereupon the echocardiography device automatically produces various calculated parameters of cardiac function (e.g., ejection fraction and aortic valve area) Erase: this allows you to remove from the display, for example, a measurement deemed erroneous Acquire: this allows you to save images and videos taken into the echocardiography device’s memory Print: this prints the image visible on the display to the printer connected to the echocardiography device End exam: this allows you to end the ongoing examination and reset all saved measurements, images, and videos (if saves have been made with the Acquire button, these remain in the echocardiography device’s mass memory) Patient: patient identification information can be entered through the screen that opens behind this button Review: images and videos saved to the echocardiography device can be viewed through the screen that opens behind this button The most important “knobs” of the Philips CX50 device (marked with yellow numbers): Depth: this allows you to expand or reduce the image area on the echocardiography device’s display Gain: this allows you to make the image darker or lighter Zoom: this allows you to zoom the image “Baseline knob”: this is the most important knob in the top row - with this you can lower or raise the baseline (= Y-axis origin) when using continuous wave Doppler, for example Echo Guidebook © 2022 by Ville Langén is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 "],["caliper.html", "Chapter 4 Caliper vs. Calc", " Chapter 4 Caliper vs. Calc Over the years, I have observed that beginning echocardiographers may have difficulty for a long time distinguishing between the following two measurement methods: “Unnamed” measurement of some parameter using the Caliper button Structurally performed measurement using parameters found behind the Calc button Figure 4.1: Caliper and Calc buttons. The only difference between the measurement methods is that from a measurement made with the Caliper button, only the measurer themselves, that is, the echocardiographer, knows what was measured. If you want the echocardiography device to calculate, for example, the ejection fraction, you must measure structurally with the device - by searching for parameters behind the Calc button - the following measurements: LVIDd (left ventricular diameter in diastole) LVIDs (left ventricular diameter in systole) Immediately when these measurements are made structurally, the echocardiography device automatically displays the left ventricular ejection fraction on the screen, whether the echocardiographer requested it or not. If, on the other hand, you measure each of the aforementioned dimensions with the Caliper button, this appears to the device as follows: Some unknown Caliper measurement was just made Then some other unknown Caliper measurement was made In practical work, an experienced echocardiographer and clinician may perform several examinations consecutively, especially during rounds, using only the Caliper function for its speed, while still gaining sufficient understanding of clinically significant echocardiographic findings for both report preparation and actual treatment. Typical measurements that can be quickly checked “unnamed” with the Caliper button: Left ventricular diameter if you just look at this with the Caliper button, the echocardiographer naturally has no intention of measuring the ejection fraction with the echocardiography device Aortic and left atrial diameters Maximum gradient measured across the aortic valve with continuous wave Doppler Tricuspid gradient TAPSE Typical measurements that are often wanted to be marked structurally using parameters found behind the Calc button: Left ventricular diameter in diastole and systole when you want the echocardiography device to calculate the ejection fraction E-, A-, and e’-waves when you want the echocardiography device to perform diastology calculations Flow velocities measured across the aortic valve and from the left ventricular outflow tract, as well as the outflow tract diameter when you want the echocardiography device to calculate the aortic valve area (AVA) Echo Guidebook © 2022 by Ville Langén is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 "],["projections.html", "Chapter 5 Projections 5.1 PSLAX 5.2 PSAX 5.3 A4C 5.4 A5C 5.5 Subcostal projection", " Chapter 5 Projections The views obtainable in echocardiography cause interpretation difficulties only for very early-stage beginners. Echocardiography is performed from only a few standard views or projections, where structures are easily visible always “in their own places”. Projections are learned quickly, after which the recognition of common cardiac structures - such as valves - does not present any difficulties. Projections have their own logical and easy letter abbreviations that are worth learning. 5.1 PSLAX The parasternal long-axis view (PSLAX, parasternal long axis view) is obtained when the transducer is moved from the center of the sternum immediately to the left. The transducer’s “bump” must point toward the patient’s sternum / right armpit. Figure 5.1: Parasternal long-axis view (PSLAX). 5.2 PSAX The parasternal short-axis view (PSAX, parasternal short axis view) is obtained by rotating the transducer 90 degrees clockwise from the parasternal long-axis view. Sometimes the transducer position needs to be slightly adjusted to restore visibility between the ribs that may have been lost during rotation. From this projection, you can scan step by step all parts of the left ventricle by tilting (not rotating!) the transducer either toward the aorta or toward the heart’s apex. In the extreme position when tilting toward the aorta, you see a cross-section of the aortic valve, and correspondingly, in the extreme position when tilting toward the heart’s apex, you see only the left ventricular apex as a small donut-like projection. In the following figure 5.2, you can see the short-axis view at the level of the left ventricular papillary muscles. In the lower figure 5.3, different tilts of the PSAX projection are presented (the rotation angle remains the same throughout, i.e., 90 degrees clockwise from PSLAX). Figure 5.2: Parasternal short-axis view (PSAX). Figure 5.3: Tilting of the parasternal short-axis view to different cross-sectional levels. 5.3 A4C 5.3.1 Standard method From the apical view - which is sometimes also called the apex view - a four-chamber view (A4C, apical four chamber view) is imaged. The standard method is to direct the “bump” laterally toward the patient’s side, whereupon the left ventricle appears on the right side of the image area - thus imaging “left on the right and right on the left”. This four-chamber projection imaging method can be recommended because it is universal, and because the automated functions of more advanced ultrasound devices are designed for this imaging method. Figure 5.4: Four-chamber view (A4C) imaged with the standard method. 5.3.2 Alternative method If, on the other hand, the “bump” is directed toward the patient’s body midline, the left ventricle appears on the left side of the image area. Then “left appears on the left and right on the right”. Both four-chamber projection imaging methods - both standard and alternative - can be used and are used here and elsewhere according to echocardiographers’ own imaging preferences. I have personally followed this alternative method out of habit, which is why several illustrative images in this guide are presented from the perspective of this alternative imaging method. Figure 5.5: Four-chamber view (A4C) imaged with the alternative method. 5.4 A5C The five-chamber view (A5C, apical five chamber view) is relatively easy to form by first obtaining a four-chamber view and then tilting the transducer tip slightly ventrally. Correspondingly, you can return to the four-chamber view by tilting the transducer tip back slightly in the dorsal direction. The most important significance of the five-chamber view is examinations and measurements directed at the aortic valve, e.g., with color Doppler and continuous wave Doppler. Sometimes the ventral tilt of the transducer seems to completely lose visibility, and sometimes the aorta opens so obliquely that measurements cannot be made across the aortic valve with continuous wave Doppler. In these cases, it often helps to move the entire transducer along the rib some distance toward the patient’s side (“toward the armpit”). Figure 5.6: Five-chamber view (A5C). 5.5 Subcostal projection The subcostal projection is obtained by placing the transducer vertically immediately caudal to the xiphoid process, with the transducer’s “bump” pointing cranially. Often a small cranial tilt toward the heart helps visualize the right atrium in the image (Figure 5.7). Additionally, a small tilt toward the liver, which I call “liver tilt,” can help visualize the inferior vena cava (IVC). The “tilts” of the subcostal projection are discussed further in chapter 10. Subcostally, you can examine other views of different cardiac chambers in addition to the projection presented in Figure 5.7. I recommend the excellent video from GE Healthcare and Prof. Thomas Binder found at this link about these projections. I also recommend the video found at this link from the YouTube channel BASIC Critical Care Ultrasound, which also presents the subcostal short-axis view. Figure 5.7: Subcostal projection.

To achieve M-mode and perform measurements with it, you need the buttons indicated in the following figure (Figure 6.1). Figure 6.1: Buttons and trackball needed to achieve M-mode. 6.2 Obtain a Good PSLAX The echocardiography device starts in the usual 2D mode. In this mode, the very first thing to do is to obtain a good PSLAX projection from the heart (Figure 6.2). Low-quality images cannot be used reliably for M-mode measurements. After this, a suitable cross-sectional line is selected by moving the cursor with the echocardiography device’s trackball. The cross-sectional line to be examined is set so that it cuts perpendicularly through the left ventricle immediately distal to the tips of the mitral valve’s opening leaflets (Figure 6.2). Figure 6.2: Quality PSLAX projection and proper cross-sectional line. 6.3 The Problem of Vertical Heart If the heart position is very vertical in the patient (Figure 6.3), M-mode does not cut the left ventricle perpendicularly, resulting in a too oblique cut of the left ventricle. This, among other things, overestimates the left ventricular cross-sectional dimension. If a proper perpendicular cut cannot be achieved, it’s not worth wasting time with M-mode but rather use, for example, LVEF measurement from 2D images, which is described later in subsection 6.5. Figure 6.3: This is not a proper PSLAX projection - don’t try to make measurements from such a projection using M-mode. 6.4 Measurable Parameters If a sufficiently quality PSLAX projection and suitable cross-sectional line have been obtained, press the M-mode button on the echocardiography device. M-mode is allowed to roll forward, and if the view appears technically sufficient quality for measurements, the image is stopped with the echocardiography device’s Freeze button (Figure 6.4). The actual measurements from the frozen image are made by first selecting the parameter to be measured (e.g., left ventricular cross-sectional dimension in diastole, etc.) from the menus that open by pressing the Calc button. This is described in more detail later. Figure 6.4: Basic M-mode view in PSLAX projection. 6.4.1 RV Measurement The right ventricle (RV) is very rarely measured in this context and projection, but for completeness, RV measurement from M-mode is also presented. From the echocardiography device’s Calc button, find the menu Main Menu under which the menu Dimensions. Select it, and then RVIDd (MM). The selections and the actual measurement from the image are made with the trackball and the mouse’s left button. Measure RV according to the example image below (Figure 6.5). Figure 6.5: Right ventricular (RV) measurement using M-mode - rarely performed measurement. Note! Don’t measure “from blood to blood” (i.e., from black signal to black) in this or any other context, but from tissue signal (gray) to the next (see Figure 6.6 and Figure 6.7 below). Figure 6.6: Always remember to measure from tissue to tissue (cardiac tissue appears gray, not black). Figure 6.7: Don’t measure “from blood to blood” (blood appears as black signal). 6.4.2 IVS Measurement Most commonly, measurement is started specifically from the interventricular septum (IVS), i.e., by first selecting Main Menu –&gt; Dimensions –&gt; IVSd (MM) from behind the Calc button. However, if you started by measuring RV, the echocardiography device automatically moves to the IVSd MM position. Measure IVS according to the example image below (Figure 6.8). Figure 6.8: Interventricular septum (IVS) measurement using M-mode. 6.4.3 LV Measurement (diastole) If you measured IVS above, the echocardiography device automatically moves directly to the left ventricular diastolic dimension (LVIDd). Sometimes the interventricular septum is demarcated so poorly in M-mode that you want to start M-mode measurements directly by measuring LVIDd. In that case, select Main Menu –&gt; Dimensions –&gt; LVIDd (MM) from behind the Calc button, and leave IVSd (and RVIDd) unmeasured in this context. Measure LVIDd according to the example image below (Figure 6.9). Figure 6.9: Left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVIDd) measurement using M-mode. 6.4.4 LVPW Measurement If you measured LVIDd above, the echocardiography device automatically moves directly to the left ventricular posterior wall (LVPWd). Otherwise, you can find it from behind the Calc button Main Menu –&gt; Dimensions –&gt; LVPWd (MM). Measure LVPWd according to the example image below (Figure 6.10). Figure 6.10: Left ventricular posterior wall (LVPWd) measurement using M-mode. 6.4.5 LV Measurement (systole) If you measured LVPWd above, the echocardiography device automatically moves directly to left ventricular measurement in systole (LVIDs). Otherwise, you can find it from behind the Calc button Main Menu –&gt; Dimensions –&gt; LVIDs (MM). Measure LVIDs according to the example image below (Figure 6.11). Figure 6.11: Left ventricular systolic diameter (LVIDs) measurement using M-mode. The last measurement to be made in M-mode in the PSLAX projection is the LVIDs measurement. After obtaining this measurement, the echocardiography device calculates and displays below the “division line” key calculated parameters (see Figure 6.12 below), which are EDV, EF, ESV, FS, IVS/LVPW, and LV Mass (Cubed). In the Turku area, it is typical to express only EF from the calculated parameters in this context, in addition to the actual measurements. Mileage may vary - different healthcare districts may have different practices in report preparation. Even the word UKG is used only in certain localities, while in others they may talk about “ekko” instead. In Turku, M-mode measurements (if RV was not measured) would be expressed concisely from the image below as follows:    “LV 40/23, from which EF 75 %. Walls 11/14.” Note that dimensions are expressed in millimeters in this context, without stating the unit “mm”. Figure 6.12: Dimensions and calculated parameters obtainable from the left ventricle using M-mode measurement. 6.5 LVEF 2D Measurement If a suitable cross-sectional line for quality M-mode cannot be obtained, nothing prevents measuring the left ventricular diameter in diastole and systole directly from 2D images (Figure 6.13). As soon as these measurements are made structurally, the echocardiography device reports the left ventricular ejection fraction. Most importantly, you must search for LVIDd and LVIDs measurements from behind the Calc button from the submenu Dimensions, so that the echocardiography device understands what measurements you are currently trying to take. In other words, don’t do these measurements with the “unnamed measurement” Caliper button! Figure 6.13: Left ventricular ejection fraction measurement in 2D mode.

The measurement is most conveniently performed from the echocardiography device’s 2D image using the Caliper button in the PSLAX projection. Additionally, you need the mouse’s left button and the Print button (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1: Caliper and Print buttons and the mouse’s left button. If you express only one measurement from the aorta, it is practically always the aortic root, and it is quite commonly marked in reports with just the abbreviation “Ao”. To measure the aortic root, first stop the moving 2D image with the Freeze button. Move the frozen image series with the trackball so that the aortic valve closes. After this, the first Valsalva sinus is marked with the mouse’s left button, the second directly with the Print button, whereupon the segment between the sinuses is measured and printed (Figure 7.2). Figure 7.2: Aortic root measurement from 2D image. The measurement is performed when the aortic valve is closed (end-diastole). 7.2 Aorta: Additional Information 7.2.1 2D vs. M-mode Measurement The aortic root is measured from 2D images according to current recommendations. The aim is to measure the maximum diameter from the base of one Valsalva sinus to the base of another. You will see that many colleagues still use M-mode for measuring the aortic root (and simultaneously the left atrium) and may be very skilled at this. However, in practice, it is difficult to get the M-mode cursor in a moving image to hit exactly such an angle that the measurement is taken representing the maximum diameter between the Valsalva sinuses. Therefore, I always measure aortic dimensions only from 2D images. Another reason is saving time: I personally find that hunting for a sufficiently good angle in M-mode would often take more time than immediate 2D measurements. In this guide, aortic root measurement using M-mode is not covered. 7.2.2 Other Aortic Dimensions Regarding reporting of aortic dimensions, my experience is as follows: if the term Ao is used in an echocardiographic study performed in the Turku area, this usually describes specifically the aortic root. This is sometimes - but by no means always - followed by other aortic dimensions. If you report multiple aortic dimensions in your report, it might be wisest not to use the abbreviation Ao at all but rather unpack that abbreviation into the form “aortic root.” The field’s umbrella organizations ASE and EACVI emphasize that only the aortic annulus measurement is performed in mid-systole (Figure 7.4), all other measurements in end-diastole (Figure 7.3). (However, I haven’t found/read these umbrella organizations’ recommendations for aortic arch measurement, so I haven’t paid much attention to the systole vs. diastole question there.) Table 7.1: Aortic dimensions typically measured with echocardiography. Aortic dimension Measurement timing From whom measured Aortic annulus Mid-systole E.g., TAVI candidates Aortic root End-diastole Always STJ End-diastole At least when aortic dilation ATA End-diastole At least when aortic dilation Aortic arch (no guidance) At least when aortic dilation Abbreviations: STJ, sinotubular junction. ATA, ascending tubular aorta. Figure 7.3: Sinotubular junction and ascending tubular aorta. The measurement is performed in end-diastole. Figure 7.4: The aortic annulus is measured in mid-systole. According to ASE and EACVI, aortic dimensions should be expressed using the so-called leading edge-to-leading edge principle. For clarity, however, in this guide all cross-sectional measurements from 2D images are presented using the inner edge-to-inner edge principle. I limit the treatment of these principles outside this guide. You can read more about this if you wish, for example, from Oxborough and colleagues’ article. 7.2.3 Aortic Reference Values As mentioned above, the aortic root should not be wider than 4 cm. Generally, the aorta narrows at the sinotubular junction, and the ascending tubular aorta is also narrower than the aortic root. More precise individual reference values for different aortic dimensions can be examined if necessary from treatment recommendations.

However, the beginner can memorize that the rough reference upper limit for the cross-sectional dimension is 4 cm. Left atrial measurement is timed to end-systole. In practice, you shouldn’t stress about timing, as the measurer can simply try to select a frame where the left atrium appears to be at its largest. Measurement from 2D images is performed most simply with the echocardiography device’s Caliper button (see chapter 4). The Valsalva sinus visible in the “roof” of the left atrium is marked with the mouse’s left button and the left atrial posterior wall directly with the Print button (Figure 8.1) in the PSLAX projection. Figure 8.1: The left atrium is measured with a line that extends from the Valsalva sinus to the left atrial posterior wall in end-systole. The direction of the line must be perpendicular to the imaginary long axis of the aortic root. 8.2 LA: Additional Information 8.2.1 LA: 2D vs. M-mode Measurement As with aortic root measurement, many colleagues are skilled at using M-mode for left atrial measurement as well. However, it is now more recommended to determine the left atrial cross-sectional dimension directly from 2D images. Most recommended would be to perform left atrial measurement from two planes by drawing from apical views. However, in this review aimed at beginners, we focus on the simpler cross-sectional dimension determination, which should be known in any case. The limitations of a single cross-sectional dimension must be understood; the left atrium may be enlarged in such a direction that a cross-sectional measurement performed from the standard position does not recognize the chamber’s enlargement. 8.2.2 LA: The Heart’s “Long Sugar” The left atrium enlarges in many heart-straining situations. Examples include left ventricular hypertrophy (and the resulting diastolic dysfunction), mitral valve regurgitation, and mitral valve stenosis. An experienced echocardiographer quickly gains an understanding of the heart’s left side status just by glancing at the left atrium - the left atrium is somewhat equivalent to a biomarker for the heart as “long sugar” is for diabetes diagnosis. 8.2.3 LA’s More Precise Reference Values More precise reference values can be found in the umbrella organizations’ treatment recommendations.

The said recommendation doesn’t start from the very basics of measurements, so I think it’s worth reading through this guide first. Especially for a beginning echocardiographer, I think it would be worth starting from the following three easily learnable basic measurements: Measurement of different wave velocities of mitral inflow using pulsed-wave Doppler (E- and A-waves) Measurement from the mitral valve’s lateral annulus using tissue Doppler (E’-wave) Assessment of left ventricular wall thicknesses The previous three can still be supported if necessary by echocardiographic measurements of left atrial size and pulmonary pressure. In practice, with echocardiographic diastology measurements, we try to guess whether the patient’s left ventricular filling pressure is normal or abnormal. We wouldn’t find out the actual filling pressure except by invasively inserting a pressure catheter into the patient’s heart. 9.1 E- and A-waves If the patient is in sinus rhythm, two separate waves are seen in diastole when the mitral valve opens, observed with pulsed-wave Doppler, which describe blood flow into the left ventricle: First the E-wave (comes from the word early), which is generated when the mitral valve opens flow into the left ventricle occurs because there is greater pressure in the left atrium at that time than in the left ventricle Then the A-wave (comes from the word atrium) flow is generated by the left atrium contracting and pushing blood into the left ventricle Mitral inflow measurement using pulsed-wave Doppler is described below (Figure 9.1). Note. If the patient is in atrial fibrillation, there is no proper contraction in the left atrium but chaotic fibrillation, so the A-wave is not seen. Figure 9.1: Pulsed-wave Doppler measurement of mitral inflow from the four-chamber view. In this hypothetical example case, the patient is in atrial fibrillation, so only E-waves are visible (note the irregular rhythm). 9.2 E- and A-waves: Interpretation The key measurements from E- and A-waves are the peak points of each wave, which represent the maximum velocities of the corresponding blood flows. From these velocities - and their mutual ratio - you can make the following conclusions about the heart’s diastolic function (Figure 9.2): In young healthy patients, the E-wave is larger than the A-wave E/A ratio &gt; 1.0 In mild diastolic dysfunction and with aging, the E/A ratio becomes inverted E/A ratio &lt; 1.0 In more severe diastolic dysfunction, the E/A ratio becomes pseudonormal E/A ratio &gt; 1.0 Figure 9.2: Different scenarios of mitral inflow. Since the above-mentioned scenarios 1 and 3 visually resemble each other (Figure 9.2), a beginning echocardiographer might think that this doesn’t cause significant difficulties in determining whether the heart’s diastolic function is completely normal or quite abnormal. In practice, more experienced echocardiographers rarely have difficulty distinguishing normal and pseudonormal mitral inflow from each other. The patient’s age and other observations made in the echocardiographic study help distinguish these scenarios from each other. Most importantly, I think it’s worth remembering that if you see a “normal” E/A ratio in an elderly person, it is rarely if ever actually normal. In elderly patients, there is practically always either inverted mitral inflow (scenario 2 above) or pseudonormal mitral inflow (scenario 3 above). For some reason, this simple mnemonic is not emphasized in the literature. 9.3 Tissue Doppler (TDI) With traditional Doppler, measurements are made of blood flows in the heart. With tissue Doppler (TDI), on the other hand, myocardial velocities are examined. When assessing diastology, the cursor is moved with the trackball to the myocardial area between the left ventricle and left atrium, immediately lateral to the mitral annulus. From the echocardiography device, press the TDI button and immediately after the PW button. Thus observed, E- and A-waves are seen with tissue Doppler as if inverted, downward-directed (Figure 9.3). These are called E’- and A’-waves in this context (pronounced in English as “E prime” and “A prime”). The E’-wave can also be measured from the mitral valve’s medial annulus, but for simplification, I present only the lateral measurement technique in this guide. Note. If the patient is in atrial fibrillation, again no A-wave (or more correctly called A’-wave in the context of tissue Doppler) is seen. Figure 9.3: Measurement made with tissue Doppler in diastology assessment. Note the blue-red image, which is seen as an indication of tissue Doppler activation. Since both E’- and A’-waves are seen, the patient is in sinus rhythm. 9.4 TDI Interpretation E- and A-wave interpretation was covered above (Figure 9.2). When both E- and E’-waves are measured structurally (named using the Calc button), the echocardiography machine automatically calculates the E/Lat E’ ratio. Research has shown that the E/E’ ratio is directly related to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and thus practically to left ventricular filling pressure. If E/Lat E’ is over 13, the result is abnormal and suggestive of increased left ventricular filling pressure (diastolic dysfunction) according to the field’s umbrella organizations.

However, in some patients, the subcostal window doesn’t offer any diagnostic visibility, which may be due to, for example, bowel gas. I have noticed that beginners sometimes confuse measurements between the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta. To solve this, I have launched a principle by which they can be easily distinguished from each other (Figure 10.1): first the inferior vena cava is identified by tilting, which I call “liver tilt” after this, the abdominal aorta is identified by “spleen tilt”. Once both the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta have been identified, they cannot be confused with each other. Figure 10.1: Identification of inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta using “liver and spleen tilting”. 10.2 2D Image Measurement I recommend measuring the inferior vena cava (IVC) from 2D images. Often you cannot get a completely perpendicular cut of the IVC from M-mode, and achieving such a cut takes unnecessary time, especially from a beginner. The IVC should not be measured right at the hepatic vein junction but about 1-3 cm “toward the feet,” as demonstrated in the image below (Figure 10.2). Images are recorded from the IVC both during expiration and inspiration. You don’t need to think separately about which phase of breathing was going on: simply measure the IVC at the same location at its widest and narrowest. I recommend that you try to get some view of the right atrium as well (Figure 10.2). The IVC connects to the right atrium, so you can be sure you’re taking measurements from exactly the IVC. Transducer tilts, which I already presented above, also help in IVC identification (Figure 10.1). Note! The limitations of IVC measurements in fluid status assessment must be recognized! I recommend reading, for example, Marik and colleagues’ review on the topic. For example, significant tricuspid regurgitation can complicate volume status assessment based on the IVC, of which I also have plenty of clinical experience. Figure 10.2: Measuring the diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) using the Caliper button. Note. Measure the diameter both during expiration and inspiration. 10.3 CVP Inference from IVC Echocardiography umbrella organizations have presented a very simple principle by which CVP can be inferred from the IVC in an instant. This principle is presented in the following table. Table 10.1: CVP inference from IVC.

I think it’s important to keep the transducer marker always pointing toward the armpit (Figure 11.1), so that the liver appears on the left side of the image and the lungs on the right side - then there are never difficulties in image interpretation. Figure 11.1: Measuring the inferior vena cava (IVC) using the Caliper button. Lung tissue is easily distinguished from other tissues because the lungs often show a few comets (B-lines), more about these below. You won’t find B-lines, for example, in the liver. If there are thoughts of puncturing the pleural effusion for one reason or another, it’s worth assessing the distance of the lungs from the puncture site using the Caliper button (Figure 11.2). I recommend familiarizing yourself with the literature - and above all consulting a senior - regarding safe puncture margins. Note! If you suspect the patient has excess pleural effusion but can’t find it with the ultrasound device, the transducer should be placed very posteriorly, practically so that it already touches the sheet. When the patient is supine, you see that pleural effusion collects posteriorly due to gravity. Figure 11.2: Assessing the amount of pleural effusion using a cardiac ultrasound device. 11.2 B-lines The moisture of the lung tissue itself is determined from B-lines. They are artifacts appearing in lung ultrasound that look like comets, which the clinician can utilize in diagnostics (Figure 11.3). B-lines have several criteria, here are some of them: they look like comets and are vertical (not horizontal) they move from side to side as the visceral and parietal pleura slide against each other (I call this phenomenon that B-lines are “like windshield wipers”) they continue from the pleura downward through the entire ultrasound view (they don’t disappear in the middle of the view) According to Lichtenstein and Mezière, three B-lines or more in one view (practically: in one intercostal space) is abnormal. I warmly recommend reading more about B-lines from their excellent article, which is freely available in PubMed Central - the article has plenty of images and recommendations for measurement locations. Likewise, Via et al. have written a very informative article on the topic, which with its numerous images can be downloaded for free from Minerva Anestesiologica’s pages (in the middle of the page there is small text “PDF”, pressing which opens the original article’s PDF file). The above-mentioned articles also tell important information about B-lines’ differential diagnosis: B-lines are not always an indication of lung congestion but can indicate, among other things, pneumonia. B-lines are living proof of Goethe’s wisdom: “You see only what you know”. Many who perform echocardiography professionally see B-lines thousands of times in their lives “accidentally” when imaging the heart, but don’t understand their significance.

A clinician learning echocardiography learns quite quickly to rule out aortic stenosis without continuous wave and pulsed-wave Doppler numerical measurements, just by visual examination. The following presents the key methods in echocardiographic diagnostics of aortic stenosis. 12.1 Visual Examination Especially the parasternal long-axis view (PSLAX) and short-axis view (PSAX) are useful for examining the aortic valve’s opening movement. If there is abundant calcium in the valve and its opening movement appears poor, aortic stenosis should be suspected. 12.2 Color Doppler If there are no restrictions in the blood flow path such as aortic stenosis, the color Doppler signal appears unicolored (laminar flow). This is beautifully described in 123sonography’s YouTube video, which you can find at this link. If blood passes through a narrowed channel, a mosaic-like color Doppler signal is seen, where yellow colors are emphasized (turbulent flow). An example of this can be seen in Mayo Clinic’s YouTube video around 1:55, here’s the link to that video. Whenever turbulent flow is seen in the aortic valve position, aortic stenosis should be suspected. 12.3 Continuous Wave Doppler Continuous wave Doppler is extremely central in the diagnostics of aortic stenosis. The measurement steps are described below (Figure 12.1). My own rule of thumb is that if the velocity glanced at with just the Caliper button is at least 4 m/s (corresponds to a 65 mmHg difference between the left ventricle and aorta), the diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis is clear, and the clinician doesn’t necessarily need more precise measurements from behind the Calc button. Figure 12.1: Gradient measurement “unnamed” with the Caliper button across the aortic valve from the continuous wave Doppler signal. Especially if the velocity glanced at with the Caliper button suggests moderate but not yet severe aortic stenosis, it’s worth additionally measuring the aortic valve area (AVA) using the continuity equation. In that case, the velocity measured with the Caliper button doesn’t work in the equation, because the echocardiography device doesn’t understand what velocity the echocardiographer measured with it - the measurement must be made structurally as the AV Vmax parameter (or AV VTI parameter). 12.4 Valve Area (AVA) The aortic valve area (AVA) measurement is performed using the continuity equation. Fortunately, you don’t need to enter the continuity equation yourself, but the echocardiography device calculates and reports it immediately when the following three parameters have been measured structurally (i.e., when measuring parameters that open from behind the Calc button): Diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) (Figure 12.2) Blood flow velocity across the aortic valve (Figure 12.3) Blood flow velocity in the outflow tract (Figure 12.4) The continuity equation is something that can be understood with common sense. We can measure key parameters related to blood flow at the LVOT, and at the same time we know that blood cannot disappear into any wormhole after the LVOT but must go through the aortic valve. Thus 1) the diameter (and simultaneously the area) measured from the LVOT and 2) the amount of blood flow help calculate the aortic valve area, once we know 3) the blood flow also at the aortic valve. These measurements are presented in the following. 12.4.1 LVOT Diameter First of all, the LVOT diameter must be measured, from which the echocardiography device then automatically determines the LVOT area as well. LVOT measurement is made structurally from 2D images (Figure 12.2). Note. Don’t use the Caliper button for LVOT measurement, because then the echocardiography device doesn’t know what structure you measured. Figure 12.2: Measurement of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter. 12.4.2 CW Measurement Across the Aortic Valve After this, continuous wave Doppler (CW) measurement is made across the aortic valve. Just maximum velocity measurement would work for the continuity equation, but it’s conventional to draw the entire envelope curve from the continuous wave Doppler signal across the aortic valve. By doing this, in addition to the maximum gradient, you also get the mean gradient across the aortic valve as a side benefit, and both are usually documented in the echocardiographic report (Figure 12.3). Figure 12.3: Measurement of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter. 12.4.3 PW Measurement from LVOT Finally, the flow velocity is measured with pulsed-wave Doppler (PW) from the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Here too, just maximum velocity measurement would work for the continuity equation, but it’s conventional to draw the entire envelope curve from the pulsed-wave Doppler signal. At the same time, in addition to the AVA, you also find out the left ventricular stroke volume (SV) as a side benefit, and it too can be documented in the echocardiographic report. The echocardiography device reports the AVA and SV immediately when the LVOT diameter, flow velocity from the aortic valve, and flow velocity from the LVOT have been measured (Figure 12.4). Figure 12.4: Measurement of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter. If the echocardiography device doesn’t report stroke volume and AVA, you did something wrong. Redo all the measurements mentioned in section 12.4 calmly, remembering all the time to avoid the Caliper button especially in these measurements.

In those measurements, a simplification was utilized, according to which the left ventricle contracts primarily horizontally. For the right ventricle, the opposite simplification can be utilized, according to which the right ventricle contracts primarily vertically. Following this way of thinking, an understanding of the right ventricular systolic function can be obtained by measuring the amplitude of the vertical movement of the lateral corner of the tricuspid annulus. This parameter is called TAPSE (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) (Figure 13.1). Figure 13.1: Definition of TAPSE. When the observation point (blue ball) is the lateral edge of the tricuspid annulus, the right ventricular movement between diastole and systole draws “sea wave”-like movement. The amplitude of this wave movement is TAPSE. 13.1.1 TAPSE Measurement The measurement is performed as follows: A representative four-chamber view is obtained, where a measurement line can be drawn from the heart’s apex directly to the lateral edge of the tricuspid annulus M-mode is activated by pressing its button The tricuspid annulus begins to draw a “sea wave,” whereupon the hypotenuse is measured from the wave’s peak to the wave’s base using Caliper button measurement. Note! The echocardiography device doesn’t report the hypotenuse but the cathetus (the amplitude of the wave movement), i.e., TAPSE. The measurement steps are described below (Figure 13.2). Figure 13.2: TAPSE measurement using M-mode. TAPSE measurement is generally very easy. The most significant beginner challenges: obtaining sufficiently good visibility to the right side of the heart distinguishing the tricuspid annulus from other right ventricular structures in the M-mode image. There is an excellent The Echo Lady video on YouTube about TAPSE measurement - I can warmly recommend it to beginners. 13.1.2 TAPSE Reference Range TAPSE should be 17 mm or above. Values below this are considered suggestive that the right ventricular systolic function is reduced. 13.2 Diameter The right ventricular diameter is determined in diastole immediately distal to the tricuspid annulus (toward the heart’s apex). This basal measurement is abbreviated in the literature as RVD1. Somewhat less commonly encountered in the literature (and even less commonly in the clinic) is the midventricular measurement, which is abbreviated as RVD2. The measurement steps are described below (Figure 13.3). Measurements are performed using the Caliper button. Figure 13.3: Performance of RVD1 and RVD2 measurements. 13.2.1 RV Measurement Reference Ranges The right ventricle’s normal dimensions are presented in the table below 13.1.
